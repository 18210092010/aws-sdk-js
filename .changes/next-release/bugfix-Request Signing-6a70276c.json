  "category": "Request Signing",
  "description": "This change allows requests to a service to be signed if the api.json doesn't specify a signatureVersion or authtype, but the configuration has a signatureVersion specified. Prior to this change, the logic to create a signer would use signatureVersion specified in the config, but the code would never reach it if api.json signatureVersion or authtype weren't defined."
